sqlalchemy-redshift
===================

This is a fork of the 
`sqlalchemy-redshift <https://github.com/sqlalchemy-redshift/sqlalchemy-redshift>`_ 
project that is installable with sqlalchemy 2 and usable with `Great Expectations <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations>`_.
It is **NOT** a fully working sqlalchemy dialect. In particular, the dialect does not support the `get_columns` method.
